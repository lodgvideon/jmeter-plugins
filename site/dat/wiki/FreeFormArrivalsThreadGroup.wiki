This plugin was inspired by _[http://www.dynatrace.com/?utm_source=jmplinnerpages&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=jmpininnerpgs&utm_campaign=JMeter%2BPlug%2BIn%2BWiki Dynatrace LLC]_, implemented by _[http://blazemeter.com/?utm_source=jmplinnerpages&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=jmpininnerpgs&utm_campaign=JMeter%2BPlug%2BIn%2BWiki BlazeMeter Inc.]_, and then contributed to community as Open Source.

== Description ==

Free-Form Arrivals TG has the same idea of "arriving users" as [ArrivalsThreadGroup Arrivals Thread Group]. It just offers free-form schedule capabilities.

== Additional behavior ==

Added {{{Use identification property for profile}}} checkbox, that enable to use separate load profile for each FreeFormArrivals Thread Group in your project.
It simplefyes load profile configuration in complex profiles, when you need to use many FreeFormArrivals Thread Groups with different load profiles.
Now you can configure them with properties individual.


How to use:
  * Enable  {{{Use identification property for profile}}} check Box.
  * Type property name inside Properties Identifier text Box: Example: {{{operation.one.loadprofile}}}
  * When start Jmeter add additional {{{-J operation.one.loadprofile=spawn(1,100,1h) -J operation.one.loadprofile.timeunit=S}}}. Or add these properties to user.properties file.

Property Syntax example:
  * {{{operation.one.loadprofile=spawn(1,100,60m) spawn(100,100,1h) spawn(spawn(100,1,3600s)}}} - This property will create test with duration of 3 Hours.
  * Awailible timeframes: {{{s - seconds, m - minutes, h - hours}}}
  * {{{operation.one.loadprofile.timeunit=M}}} - Will be used Minute for timeunit in load profile. spawn(100,100,1h) - will be 100 thread will be created per minute.

Known issues:
  * Current load profile ui configuration will be overriden by configuration from property.
  * Load Graph is displayed, based on selected timeunit from UI. But it will be not used in real test. So - test duration will be calculated incorrect in UI. But it works fine in real tests:
  * When use property: default timeUnit is Seconds. To specify timeUnit, run Jmeter with additional jvm property with {{{[cpecified property name].timeunit=M}}}.
